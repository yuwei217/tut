## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r , echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

This is the introduction all of us have to use. Let's figure out how to do it! 

\section*{Country China and Thailand"}
```{r}
cases<- read_csv("~/git/Tutorial8/Data/worldwidecases.csv")
```

```{r}
China_cases <- cases %>% filter(countriesAndTerritories== "China")
china_cases <- China_cases %>% select(month, cases)
    
ggplot(China_cases, aes(x = dateRep,
y = cases)) +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("Date") + 
  ylab("Cases") +
theme_bw()
china_cases



```




good luck
